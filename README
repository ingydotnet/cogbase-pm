DESCRIPTION
    This module installs a command line utility called "cogbase" for
    interfacing with a cogbase.

WHAT IS COGBASE?
    CogBase is database of sorts. It is best to describe it by listing its
    properties:

        * CogBase is a defined way to store and access data.
        * CogBase is not tied to an implementation.
        * A CogBase stores data as Nodes
        * Every node has a UUID. Like: H4CPTKU4MJI7IS2DZTFFLXKB7M
        * Every node id has an eternally unique short id. Like H4CP
        * Nodes have revisions.
        * Revisions are immutable. Once saved they never change.
        * Each revision has a revision number 1-n. Like 01.
        * Revision numbers are usually written with a leading 0.
        * H4CP is the tracking id. It refers to the latest revision.
        * H4CP07 is a reference to the 7th revision of H4CP.
        * Every node has a Type.
        * Every type has a description, called a Schema.
        * Schemas are saved as nodes in the cogbase.
        * Schema nodes are of type Schema.
        * You may not save a node of type Foo, without first saving a Schema node describing type Foo.
        * Nodes are a mapping of string keys to typed values.
        * Values can be plain text or pointers to other node ids.
        * Values can be defined as optional or required, and scalar or list of the given type.
        * CogBase can be fully accessed through a REST interface.
        * ... more later ...
